Bourne Shell Programming
========================

> As with any programming language, it is very easy to write sh scripts that don't do what you want, so a healthy dose of paranoia is a good thing. In particular, scripts that take input from the user must be able to handle any kind of input. CGI-bin scripts will almost certainly be given not only incorrect, but malicious input. Errors in scripts that run as root or bin can cause untold damage as well.
